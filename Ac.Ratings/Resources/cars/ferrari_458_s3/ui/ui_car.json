  "description": "The Ferrari 458 Stage 3, has extensive modifications to the suspension springs and dampers, similar to those seen on the 458 challenge trofeo car. It sits much lowered to the ground, taking full advantage of the underbody aerodynamics. It is also much lighter than the road car weighting under 1200kg. This brings to the surface the amazing engine and handling, while overall grip is well supported by slick tyres.<br><br>While it&#39;s true that every Ferrari is innovative by definition, it&#39;s equally true that in the course of the Prancing Horse&#39;s history, certain cars have marked a genuine departure from the current range. This is very much the case with the Ferrari 458 Italia, which is a massive leap forward from the company&#39;s previous mid-rear engined sports cars.<br><br>The Ferrari 458 Italia is a completely new car from every point of view: engine, design, aerodynamics, handling, instrumentation and ergonomics, just to name a few.<br><br>The 458 Italia is designed for owners for whom the priority is uncompromising on-road performance with occasional track day capability, but who still demand a car that is useable in day-to-day driving like all Ferrari&#39;s recent models.",
