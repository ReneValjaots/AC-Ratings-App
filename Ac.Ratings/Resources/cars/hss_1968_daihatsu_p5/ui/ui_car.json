  "description": "Daihatsu by the mid 60s was a major constructor in the Japanese motorsports scene. Their special prototype car lineage, dubbed the P-series, originating as far back as 1965 remains one of the most interesting types of racing cars to come from Japan.<br><br>The breakthrough car came in 1966, with the Compagno based P-3. Due to the small engine installed in the P-3, it was allowed to run the lowest class at the 1966 Japan Grand Prix. An easy victory for the Daihatsu brand followed. In 1967, Daihatsu debuted the P-5; an all new prototype running the R92 I4 engine of just 1.298cc put into a lightweight and aerodynamic body. Daihatsu made full use of their windtunnel, a uniquem in Japan at the time, making the car very aerodynamically efficient. Sadly, the R92 engine was underdeveloped and saw neither 1967 Japan Grand Prix entrants succeed in breaking the 2:20 minimum lap time enforced for the race. <br><br>Daihatsu then retired the P-5 from competition to rework the car. Returning by March 1968, the P-5X had a revised R92B engine now producing up to 138bhp, a restyled and lightened body (now coming in at just 510kg) alongside minor chassis improvements. Daihatsu entered 5 cars at the 1968 Japan Grand Prix and were all allocated in the lowest class due to the small engine mounted in the middle. Not all P-5&#39;s survived the race, but #15 snatched up the class win for Daihatsu for the first time since 1966. <br><br>Following on from the Grand Prix, Daihatsu entered two P-5&#39;s for the remainder of 1968&#39;s Japan Endurance racing season with further class wins at the Suzuka 1000km, NET Speed Cup and in 1969 the Suzuka 300km. Daihatsu was taken over by Toyota by this time and ended the P-series programme permanently.",
