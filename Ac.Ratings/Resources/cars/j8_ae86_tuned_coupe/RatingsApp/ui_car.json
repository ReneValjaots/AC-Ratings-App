Also big thanks to SIMT for the original convert of the hatchback AE86<br><br>The AE86 generation of the Toyota Sprinter Trueno is a small, lightweight coupe or hatchback introduced by Toyota in 1983.<br><br>In classic Toyota code, the &#39;A&#39; represents the engine that came in the car (4A series), &#39;E&#39; represents the Corolla, &#39;8&#39; represents the fifth generation (E80 series) and &#39;6&#39; represents the variation within this generation.<br><br>Even after production of the car was discontinued in 1987, many privateer teams still raced the AE86, and it is still a popular choice for rallying and club races today.<br><br>Part of the continued appeal of the AE86 for motorsports is its rear-drive configuration, a feature not available in most newer lightweight coupes.",
