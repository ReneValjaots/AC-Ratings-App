  "description": "Introduced in 1984, the Audi Sport quattro S1 E2 revolutionized rallying. Just like the other manufacturers, Audi used the lenient homologation requirements to create a new rally car. All the car maker needed for homologation was a production run of a mere 200 cars.<br>Blomqvist&#39;s spectacular, sideways driving style suited the Sport quattro perfectly. By flicking the tail out, the Swede overcame the natural understeer of the nose-heavy Audi. He won five of the twelve rounds and was crowned the 1984 World Champion. Mikkola and Roehrl also won a round, which was enough to clinch the constructor&#39;s trophy as well.",
