  "description": "With its wheelbase shortened by a meaningful 12.6 inches between the B- and C-pillars, the Audi Sport quattro was not only significantly shorter than the standard Quattro found in showrooms, but its steel monocoque shell also featured numerous GRP and carbon-kevlar panels to further trim weight. As such, there was very little shared with serial production Audis. <br><br>By the end of the production in 1984, Audi had produced 224 examples of what remains as one of the great homologation specials of the 1980s.<br><br>The step version offers a lowered and stiffer suspension with more open setup possibilities, the turbo from the Group-B rally racer and lockable centre and rear differential.",
