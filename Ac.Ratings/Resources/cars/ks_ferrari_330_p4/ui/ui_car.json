  "name": "Ferrari 330 P4",
  "brand": "Ferrari",
  "description": "With a styling very similar to that of the 330 P3, this model was powered by a V12 engine that had been radically redesigned by Franco Rocchi. The most obvious modification was the introduction of a three-valve cylinder head â€“ two inlet and one exhaust.<br><br><br>Fuel feed was provided by a Lucas injection system. The chassis was slightly shorter than the 330 P3&#39;s, and the new suspension system improved roadholding. The car won numerous races and earned its place in the history books after a memorable 1-2-3 at Daytona.",
