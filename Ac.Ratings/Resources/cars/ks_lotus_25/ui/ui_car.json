  "description": "The Lotus 25 was a racing car designed by Colin Chapman for the 1962 Formula One season.<br><br>The revolutionary fully stressed monocoque made the car more rigid and structurally stronger than typical F1 cars of the period. This was three times stiffer than the Lotus 24, while the chassis weighed only half as much. The car also was extremely low and narrow, with a smaller frontal area and was nicknamed &#39;The Bathtub&#39; since the driver has to sit reclined behind the wheel.<br><br>In the hands of Jim Clark it took 14 World Championship Grand Prix wins and propelled him to his 1963 World Championship title.",
