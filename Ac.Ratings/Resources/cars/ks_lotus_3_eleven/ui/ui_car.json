Based on the Road version, the Race includes a much more aggressive aero kit, a sequential gearbox and an FIA approved driver’s seat with a six-point harness.<br><br><br>Assetto Corsa simulates the Race version. With a dry weight of below 900kg (Race version), the 3-Eleven offers an enviable power to weight ratio, in excess of 500hp per tonne, and is capable of sprinting from 0-60 mph in less than 3.0 seconds before reaching a maximum speed of 290km/h for the Race version and 280 km/h for the Road version",
