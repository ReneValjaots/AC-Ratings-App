  "description": "Maserati Levante is the first SUV in the brand&#39;s more than one hundred year history.<br><br>The design of the Levante features clear associations with the Maserati brand and its distinctive Italian character: the aggressive front introduces new, tapered headlights separated into two elements, with the upper headlight unit connected to the radiator grille. Maserati&#39;s design signature is clearly visible on the sides: the three iconic air vents on the front wings, the trapezoidal C-pillar with the &quot;Saetta&quot; logo and the large, frameless door windows. The rear is dominated by the very tapered back window and streamlined shape, both typical of a high-performance sports car.<br><br>At a technical level, the Levante&#39;s chassis is designed to combine the outstanding on-road performance typical of every Maserati with unrivalled handling even on very low-grip surfaces and an excellent off-road performance and ride. The new SUV boasts a high level of content as standard, with all versions featuring: sophisticated electronic suspension with controlled damping and air springs, which can be set on several levels, &quot;Q4&quot; intelligent all-wheel drive and 8-speed automatic transmission specially calibrated for the brand&#39;s new SUV.",
