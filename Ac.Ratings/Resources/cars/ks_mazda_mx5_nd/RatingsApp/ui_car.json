  "description": "In terms of design, the latest edition of the best-selling roadster in history is arguably the<br>sportiest ever.<br><br>And what its looks promise, the technology can deliver. Under the bonnet, high-compression SKYACTIV-G petrol engines drive the rear wheels, while the specially-developed SKYACTIV-Chassis ensures the most advanced &#39;Jinba Ittai&#39; driver-and-car-as-one experience yet, including a choice of two ultra-efficient petrol engines (131bhp and 160bhp), and the first offered with a range of modern active safety and connectivity systems. At the same time, the MX-5 has remained true to its focus on lightweight simplicity and pure driving fun, dropping some 100kg relative to the third-generation model.<br><br>This MX-5 retains the charm, reliability, affordability and above all lightweight fun of the original model launched 25 years ago.",
