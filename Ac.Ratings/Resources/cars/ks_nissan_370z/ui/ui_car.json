  "description": "Though it has now been 45 years since the arrival of the original 240Z, its influence remains strong in the sports car world and in the design of the current generation 370Z Coupe. The iconic shape, formed by the combination of a short wheelbase, wide track, low center of gravity and fluid silhouette, is as instantly recognizable today as it was in 1970.<br><br>Even more than racing-inspired aerodynamic bodies and driver-oriented cockpit-style interiors, at its core NISMO is all about performance. To that end, the 370Z NISMO includes a potent 350-horsepower 3.7-liter DOHC V6 engine with Variable Valve Event and Lift Control (VVEL). The 370Z NISMO&#39;s enhanced engine power and acceleration is provided through use of an exclusive H-configured exhaust system design and muffler tuning, along with optimized ECM (Engine Control Module) calibration, to help create 18 horsepower more than a standard 370Z. Torque is rated at 276 lb-ft.",
