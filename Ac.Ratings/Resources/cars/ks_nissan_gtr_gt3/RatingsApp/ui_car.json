  "description": "The NISSAN GT-R NISMO GT3, which was developed in line with the FIA GT3 regulations, debuted in 2012. In its first year it competed vigorously in events such as the SUPER GT GT300, the Super Taikyu and the British GT Championship and it attained a number of podium finishes. Furthermore, in 2013 it was the Blancpain Endurance Series Pro-Am class championship vehicle.<br><br>Using the same VR38DETT engine used in mass production vehicles, it has a maximum output of more than 550ps, generating a maximum torque of over 65.0kgf/m. With only a 6-speed sequential spec gearbox equipped with a semi-automatic paddle shift, the drive system is a FIA regulation approved rear wheel drive. Even more than the 2013 model, which has already demonstrated its speed in the GT3 race world, reliability has been improved and a total reduction in running costs has been achieved.",
