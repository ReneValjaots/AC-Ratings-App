  "description": "The chassis of the new 911 R is based on the 911 GT3 and provides extremely sporty day-to-day driving. The tuning is extremely direct and the vehicle lies as low as the 911 GT3. All the chassis control systems have been adapted to the manual transmission.<br><br><br>At low speeds, the specially adapted system on the new 911 R steers the rear wheels in the opposite direction to the front wheels. This increases agility, particularly in tight bends. During high-speed manoeuvres, the system steers the rear wheels in the same direction as that of the front wheels. This enhances stability, particularly at high driving speeds.<br><br><br>The large-volume flat-six naturally aspirated engine sits right at the back of the new 911 R. Its high-performance unit delivers an impressive maximum engine speed of 8,500 rpm. With its 4-litre displacement it delivers 368 kW (500 hp), corresponding to an output of 92 kW 125 hp) per litre. The maximum torque is 460 Nm at 6,250 rpm.<br><br><br>With the very short shift travel of the 6-speed GT sports manual transmission, the 911 R accelerates from 0 to 100 kmh in only 3.8 seconds â€“ provided you&#39;re nimble with the shift lever. Top speed is reached in 6th gear: at 323 kmh. <br><br><br>Power development of this kind is only possible with a high power-to-weight ratio. With the new 911 R this is a remarkable 2.7 kg/hp.",
