  "description": "Using the lightweight mid-engine sports car Cayman GT4 as its basis, Porsche Motorsport has developed a racing version solely for the track. Geared for performance, just like its drivers.<br><br><br>The Cayman GT4 Clubsport is powered by a 3.8 liter mid-mounted flat-six engine, with an output of 385 hp (283 kW) and a maximum torque of 420 Nm. It reaches a top speed of 295 km/h. <br><br><br>The racing version features a Porsche double clutch transmission with shift paddles on the steering wheel and a mechanical rear-axle locking differential. The lightweight suspension strut front axle system is taken from its big 911 GT3 Cup brother, which is campaigned in Porsche&#39;s 20 one-make championships around the world. The impressive racing brake system is fitted with steel brake discs all round measuring 380-millimeters in diameter. <br><br><br>Tipping the scales at just 2866 lbs. (1,300 kilograms), the Cayman GT4 Clubsport, delivered from the factory with a welded-in safety cage, a racing bucket seat as well as a six-point harness, is truly lightweight and provides the car with a unique agility and driving dynamics on the track.",
