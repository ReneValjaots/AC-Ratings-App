  "description": "The 86 is a series of grand tourer sports coup&#233;s jointly developed by Toyota and Subaru and solely manufactured by the latter. <br><br><br>The 86&#39;s engine is a naturally aspirated four-cylinder engine that uses Subaru&#39;s horizontally opposed boxer engine layout. Toyota added their D-4S injection system which uses both direct and port injection. The engine has a 12.5:1 compression ratio and a bore and stroke of 86 mm that results in 200 bhp at 7,000 rpm and 205Nm of torque at 6,000 rpm.<br><br><br>The 86 was designed around a front-mounted boxer engine, rear-wheel drive configuration, inspired by the Toyota AE86. The flat architecture of the boxer engine allows it to be mounted low, dropping the center of gravity down, resulting in sporty handling characteristics. The exterior design of the 86 was inspired by the Toyota 2000GT&#39;s extremely low-to-the-ground profile and long, sleek hood.<br><br><br>It is sold worldwide under three different brands with respective model names:<br><br>- Toyota 86 in Asia, South Africa, South America and Australia; GT86 in Europe; both of the preceding names in New Zealand; FT86 in Jamaica;<br><br>- Subaru BRZ worldwide;<br><br>- Scion FR-S in the US and Canada.",
