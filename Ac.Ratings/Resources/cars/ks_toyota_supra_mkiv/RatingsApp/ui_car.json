  "description": "In 1979 the Supra&#39;s 2.6-liter inline-6 engine was the first Toyota production engine to be equipped with electronic fuel injection. The Supra was available with both a manual and automatic transmission, and came standard with 4-wheel-independent suspension and 4-wheel disc brakes.<br><br>With the exception of minor styling updates, the next major change occurred in 1993, when the Supra entered the realm of &quot;supercars.&quot; Available in both Turbo and non-Turbo guise, the new Supra was a radical departure from Supras of old. Performance was now the name of the game, and many weight saving measures were employed -- Toyota went so far as to equip the vehicle with hollow carpet fibers and make the rear spoiler (optional on Turbo models) hollow. <br><br>The Turbo model was hailed by all major magazines as a true worldbeater. With 320hp, the vehicle was capable of 0-100 km/h sprints in under 5 seconds, and carried on to an electronically-limited top speed of 250 km/h. This was the highest level of performance and the strongest commitment to performance Toyota had ever placed in one vehicle.",
