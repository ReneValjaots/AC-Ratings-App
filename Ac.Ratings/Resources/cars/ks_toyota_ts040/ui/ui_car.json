  "description": "Thanks to the 480hp exerted by electric motors on the four-wheel drive, in addition to the 520hp produced by its 3.7-liter petrol engine, the TS040 HYBRID expresses a maximum power of 1.000hp and represents the ultimate expression of Hybrid technology applied to the world racing.<br><br>The transition to a hybrid four-wheel drive Toyota sees the return to a philosophy that since 2007 has been part of the development of hybrid technology applied to racing, when the Supra HV-R-wheel drive was the first hybrid to win an endurance competition, the 24 Hours of Tokachi.<br><br>The new unit TOYOTA HYBRID Racing has been specifically developed according to the new technical regulations specified by the WEC, particularly frugal. It requires a 25% reduction in fuel consumption compared to 2013, with savings achieved through interventions on the engine, aerodynamic efficiency and driving dynamics.",
