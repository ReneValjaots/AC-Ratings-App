  "description": "Lotus Cars unveils its latest special edition - the Exige Scura, so called due to its dramatic matt black and carbon fibre theme, at the Tokyo International Motorshow on 21st of October 2009. <br><br><br>Translated as &#39;dark&#39; from Italian, the name &#39;Scura&#39; reflects the stealth character of this already fierce looking Lotus and its stunning soft-feel matt black paint finish. Limited to just 35 cars globally, this Exige evokes a desire to &#39;indulge your dark side&#39;.<br><br><br>Whilst there is no doubt that this is a visually stunning car, the Exige Scura is not just about its looks - it begs to be taken on track, and its racing character encompasses poise, power and technology to make it a serious contender. Equipped with the most powerful engine in the Exige range and generating 260PS, the Exige Scura achieves a top speed of around 245 km/h and reaches 0-100 kmh in just 4.1 seconds.",
