  "description": "The R33 GTS began limited production in 1992 and was officially introduced in August of 1993: nearly a full two years before the GT-R. The GTS was the rear wheel drive version of the Skyline lineup, powered by either a two-liter RB20E SOHC engine, or a two and a half-liter RB25 DOHC engine in naturally aspirated or turbocharged form.<br><br>The R33 GTS-25t was powered by the RB25DET DOHC turbocharged engine, and delivered its power via a five-speed manual gearbox. Viscous Limited Slip Differential was standard in GTS-25t models, and Active Limited Slip Differential was a rare factory option in some Type M specifications. The RB25DET also featured a two-stage turbocharging setup, where initial turbo pressure was limited for minimized wheelspin and a more direct naturally aspirated feel.<br><br>Compared to the R32 GTS, the front suspension geometry was completely changed, and the rear suspension received a design similar to the S14 Multi-link rear suspension. Contrary to popular belief, most parts between the GT-R and GTS are not interchangeable due to the differences. The R33 also received Super HICAS electronic rear-wheel steering, replacing the slower hydraulic system used in the R32.<br><br>The R33 had a different, more rounded body shape compared to the R32, and the wheelbase was longer. The GTS Series I received a new rear spoiler design, while the Series II received a new rear wing design similar to the wing that originally would have made it&#39;s way onto the R33 GT-R. Type-M cars came with Bridgestone Potenza RE010 tires.",
