  "description": "EXTRA_A = Open Hood<br>EXTRA_B = Open Trunk<br><br>The 190E was born in 1982, and it was your regular front-engine, rear-wheel drive sedan of the ‘80s. Once the engine got to Cosworth, they gave it dual overhead camshafts and 4 valves per cylinder, raising the power up to 183 hp (185 ps) for the road cars and 320 hp (324 ps) in race form.<br><br>The first track appearance for the enhanced 190E took place in 1984, on the newly renovated N&#252;rburgring, with Ayrton Senna piloting one to the win. It went on to be pretty competitive the following years, but it reached new grounds in 1988, when Mercedes decided to put their full weight behind it. Competition was really close, but it fell short of the BMW E30 M3.  The two giants traded blows for the next years, but in 1992 Mercedes finally achieved their goal, and the podium was stacked with 190E drivers.<br><br>In 1988, the 2.3-liter engine was replaced by a 2.5-liter (152 ci) variant with a little more oomph. Based on this, in March 1989, one of the most sought-after variants of the 190E was launched at the Geneva Motor Show. It was called the Evolution 1 and it was built as a direct response to the M3 Evolution, its primary competitor.<br><br>As the name implies, there is an Evolution I and II, but the car in question today is the Evo 1. Anyway, good luck finding any of them, as for example only 502 units of the Evo I were made. On the outside, it is painted in Blue Black Metallic and sits on 16-inch Evo I alloy wheels wrapped in ContiPremiumContact 2 rubber. To make sure that you know you’re driving something special, it has a unique body kit with wider wheel arches, different bumpers, and a rear spoiler.",
