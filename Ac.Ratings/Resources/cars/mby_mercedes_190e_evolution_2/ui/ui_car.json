  "description": "EXTRA_A = Open Hood<br>EXTRA_B = Open Trunk<br><br>Mercedes-Benz went all out with their 201 model series at the Geneva Motor Show from 8 to 18 March 1990: the 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II – soon referred to as the “EVO II” by fans – celebrated its premiere there some 30 years ago. The 173 kW (235 PS) saloon was the so-called homologation model for the identically badged DTM touring race cars of the famous brand with the star. <br><br>The super sports car made a dazzling entrance, whereby the rear wing alone visually cued the “EVO II” as the brand’s top-tree offering when it came to its sports car line-up. The rather box-shaped aerodynamic piece was developed by R&#252;diger Faul (Mercedes-Benz) and Professor Richard L&#228;pple (Stuttgart University of Technology). A front spoiler was also fitted and could be adjusted.<br><br>Mercedes-Benz built only 502 units of the 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II out of a total of some 1.9 million saloon cars from the 201 model series. This rarity, coupled with the sports car’s exclusive equipment configuration, makes it a particularly coveted classic.<br><br>The reason for the small production run had to do with the “EVO II” serving as the homologation model for the DTM touring race cars of the same name. Homologation rules specify that a minimum of 500 vehicles of the respective model configuration must be delivered to customers.",
