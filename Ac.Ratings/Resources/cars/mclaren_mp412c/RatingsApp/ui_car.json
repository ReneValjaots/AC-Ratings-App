  "description": "The 12C has been created at the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking, UK under the same roof as McLaren Racing and the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes Formula 1 team: ‘performance&#39; lies at the heart of the 12C and the McLaren Automotive team responsible for its design, development, engineering and now manufacture.<br><br>Starting from a clean sheet of paper, the 12C is the first ‘pure McLaren&#39;. From its conception, the 12C has been designed around the driver with a carbon chassis. Every one of the 12C&#39;s components is bespoke, and there to either enhance performance or contribute to the unmatched driving experience.<br><br>Now, the 12C takes carbon innovation to a new level. It is based on a unique one-piece moulded carbon chassis: the MonoCell, which weighs just 75kgs (165lbs). The MonoCell concept required it to provide the perfect combination of occupant space, structural integrity, light weight, and relatively low construction costs. And the ideal chassis from which to deliver ground-breaking efficiency and performance in the sports car market.",
