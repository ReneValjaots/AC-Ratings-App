  "description": "Based on a V-spec model, the car has undergone a 9 months long restoration and tuning process in the legendary Nismo Omori Factory based in Yokohama. The car was completely taken apart and the white body ground-up restoration of the chassis that has been performed on the factory demo cars was done, this is the essential step that guarantees a total restoration to conditions even superior to the original factory finish. The stock RB26 has been replaced with a brand new modified S1 powerplant. Nismo has always been criticized for its conservative approach and relatively outdated tuning methods, but, hate it or love it, the allure of a completely refreshed BNR34 is undeniable.<br><br>Credits:<br>Model: Kunos<br>3d/Physics - Emfini, K.
