  "description": "After seven years of hard work I am now able to tell you a little brief history and the path that led to the birth of the Huayra, project name C9.<br><br>The Huayra is made of more than 4000 components (engine and gearbox not included). To create them and put them together requires creativity, patience and passion that I shared with a fantastic young team and with the most competent partner in all sectors.<br><br>The active suspension in the front and the 4 flaps allow to optimally balance the drag coefficient and downforce.<br><br>Mercedes-AMG has created a truly unique and lightweight engine, a twin turbo with 730 HP and 1000 Nm of torque that perfectly complements the car giving a feeling that has motivated our research: that of the brute force of an airplane taking off.<br><br>Horacio Pagani",
