  "description": "The Mercedes-Benz 190 introduced in 1982 rapidly made a name for itself as the Baby-Benz. But who would have thought that it would also acquire a reputation as a compact sports car over the years and after several engine and equipment refinements?<br><br>The 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II - celebrated its world premiere at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1990. The EVO II stood out for its bodywork modifications designed to reduce drag still further and to raise downforce at the front and rear axles. Particularly distinctive and eye-catching features were the large rear airfoil and the wheelarch flares. The EVO II caused quite a stir, quite literally. Within three months, a small series of 502 units was produced to obtain homologation for motor sport.<br><br>Original mod by JP combined with the version from AO Car Mods and then improved by Opperslang<br><br>Updated by Opperslang &amp; GADU<br>- Remapped some interior AO<br>- Fixed exterior spoiler AO<br>- Fixed some exterior plastic AO<br>- Added front plate holder<br>- Changed textures and shaders of interior<br>- Tweaked exterior textures and shaders<br>- Changed colour of turn signals to stock orange<br>- Added COCKPIT_HR<br>- Interior emissive lights<br>- Fixed taillights<br>- Interior and exterior turnsignals<br>- Improved gauge lighting<br>- Odometer<br>- Dashboard icons<br>- PBR shaders<br>- Working gauge clock, oil pressure, water temp and eco<br>- Interior windscreen reflection<br>- Stock skin (car was only available in this color): skin 1<br>- Era correct Mercedes colors: skin 2 through 10<br>- LODS<br>- New wiper animation<br>- New wheel model<br>- Refraction<br>- Car and driver animation<br><br><br>Credits<br>Original mod- JP + AO Mods<br>Update - Opperslang<br>Physics - JP, VR Driving, GADU<br>- Binary Motors<br>- WAGOOONNNNNN BABYYYYY - macedosti",
