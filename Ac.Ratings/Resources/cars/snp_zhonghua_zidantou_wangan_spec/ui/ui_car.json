  "description": "This car is modified for use in SRP Slow Cars Server<br>This version uses the later GA16 engine instead of the Daihatsu CB70 to provide needed additional power.<br><br>The Zhonghua Zidantou (CHB6401TA) is a special car from China. Produced by the Beijing Zhonghua Automobile Manufacturing Co. Ltd from 1994 to 1999/2000 its one of China&#39;s many venture into the domestic automotive market.<br><br>This car is mostly comprised of Tianjin Xiali parts (Licensed copy of Daihatsu Charade) including engine and suspension. The body are made from Fiber Reinforced Plastic so it has the advantages of being rustproof and lightweight. The headlights are sourced from Honda with taillights from GM. It&#39;s truly a mix-and-match combination.<br><br>The car never caught on in the market due to FRP not being suitable for mass production and quality issues such as cracked bodies and windshields. Later cars had more rounded off windows which became smaller likely toward the end, and possibly even a GA16 Nissan engine, but new emissions regulation forced them to ultimately cease production.<br><br>Credits:<br>3D Model: Snips<br>Assetto Corsa Port and CSP work: ZZ<br>Physics&amp;Information: mugenn<br>Wiper Blade: Polyphony Digital<br>Sound: Vilau<br>Paints: Draik and some other people<br>If you worked on this car but didn&#39;t get credit sorry.
