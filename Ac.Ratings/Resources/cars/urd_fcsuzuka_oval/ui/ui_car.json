  "description": "The Dallara DW12 is a racing car developed and produced by Italian manufacturer Dallara for use in the IndyCar Series. It was developed for use in the 2012 IndyCar Series season, replacing the aging Dallara IR5 chassis and would be used for the next six seasons until its successor is introduced in 2018 due to series&#39; philosophy of upgrading its chassis every six years since 2012. The DW12 was introduced after 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championships. The chassis named after Dan Wheldon, who was killed at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on October 16, 2011.<br><br>Starting in 2012 the series moved to using a common chassis supplied by Dallara. Using a single supplier to supply chassis was introduced as a cost control method, and IndyCar has negotiated a fixed cost of $349,000 per chassis. The new specification of chassis also improved safety, the most obvious feature being the partial enclosure around the rear wheels.<br><br>This chassis is intended to support multiple aerodynamic kits, but the introduction of these has been delayed until 2014 with teams citing costs. The introduction of these kits was later postponed again. They are now scheduled to be introduced at the start of the 2015 season with Honda and Chevrolet supplying the alternatives to the Dallara package.<br><br>On 18 October, Italian manufacturer Dallara confirmed that the 2012 series car would be named after the late IndyCar driver Dan Wheldon (DW12) in honour of his work testing the car before his death two days prior at Las Vegas, with the new bumper/nerf bar section being featured, it was designed to prevent many similar single-seater crashes such as the one that killed Wheldon. The nomenclature is similar to that of the old Formula One team Ligier, whose cars were labeled JSxx in memory of French F1 driver Jo Schlesser after his death at the 1968 French Grand Prix.<br><br>Dallara cars have won twelve of the sixteen Indianapolis 500s they have contested. In 2013, Dallara reached its milestone 200th Indy car victory at Barber.",
