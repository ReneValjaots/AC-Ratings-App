  "description": "The Mercedes-Benz CLR was a set of racing cars developed for Mercedes-Benz through a collaboration with in-house tuning division Mercedes-AMG and motorsports specialists HWA GmbH. Designed to meet Le Mans Grand Touring Prototype (LMGTP) regulations, the CLRs were intended to compete in sports car events during 1999, most notably at the 24 Hours of Le Mans which Mercedes had last won in 1989.<br><br>Three CLRs were entered for Le Mans in 1999 after the team performed nearly 22,000 mi (35,000 km) of testing. The cars suffered aerodynamic instabilities along the circuit&#39;s long high-speed straight sections. The car of Australian Mark Webber became airborne and crashed in qualifying, requiring it to be rebuilt. Webber and the repaired CLR returned to the track in a final practice session on the morning of the race, but during its first lap around the circuit, the car once again became airborne and landed on its roof. Mercedes withdrew the damaged CLR but chose to continue in the race despite the accidents. The remaining cars were hastily altered and the drivers were given instructions to avoid closely following other cars.<br><br>Nearly four hours into the race Scotsman Peter Dumbreck was battling amongst the race leaders when his CLR suffered the same instability and became airborne, this time vaulting the circuit&#39;s safety barriers, crashing into trees and then coming to rest in an open field after several somersaults. This and earlier incidents led Mercedes not only to withdraw its remaining car from the event immediately, but also to cancel the entire CLR programme and move the company out of sports car racing. The accidents led to changes in the regulations dictating the design of Le Mans racing cars as well as alterations to the circuit itself to increase safety.",
