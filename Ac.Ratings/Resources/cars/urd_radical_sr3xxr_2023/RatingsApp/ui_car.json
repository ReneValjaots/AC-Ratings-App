  "description": "Radical Motorsport has unveiled the full specification of its all-new SR3 XXR. Enhancing the proven formula of the SR3, the UK-based motorsport firm has focused on performance, usability and durability while retaining the essence of what makes the SR3 the most successful prototype-style sports racing car in the world.<br>SR3 models currently make up the majority of grids in the 12 Radical Cup championships around the world, with over 1,500 sold to date. Today, the team behind the renowned SR3 has confirmed that it has upgraded the model - and it is now available to order in SR3 XXR guise - to be more thrilling and provide drivers with the power to lap for longer, with more agility and speed.<br>Powering the major change is the all-new engine from in-house Radical Performance Engines (RPE). Delivering 232 bhp from the revised 1500 cc unit, the lightweight SR3 XXR is expected to maintain its impressive power-to-weight ratio exceeding 350 hp per tonne. With the ability to run on biofuel from day one, the use of the Generation 5 engine also makes the SR3 XXR the first Radical that can run on biofuel.<br>Delivering on customer feedback, the SR3 XXR has been modified to be more agile on track, especially in crucial pit lane stages in which saving time, while not being penalised for speeding, is pivotal. With a new pit limiter fitted as standard, the chance of being punished for speeding through the pit lane is eliminated. The LMP-inspired central tail ‘shark fin’ delivers notable aerodynamic improvement to entry and mid corner stability. The SR3 XXR is also clearly differentiated by its lightweight wheels in a new design alongside high-intensity DRL lights. A carbon fibre splitter and rear diffuser will be offered as an option to improve durability and aerodynamics on track.",
